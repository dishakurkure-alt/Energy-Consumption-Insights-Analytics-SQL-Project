This SQL project performs a detailed Building Energy Consumption Analysis using MySQL.
The dataset includes parameters such as timestamp, temperature, humidity, occupancy, HVAC usage, lighting status, renewable energy contribution, and total energy consumption.

Using SQL queries, the project analyzes:

🔍 Key Insights Extracted :

Average energy consumption by day of the week
Holiday vs. Non-holiday consumption comparison
Impact of HVAC ON/OFF on energy usage
Peak energy hours based on hourly consumption trends
Buildings with high renewable energy contribution
Additional temperature-based sorting for deeper analysis

🛠 SQL Skills Demonstrated :

Database creation & table design
Data filtering, grouping, and aggregation
Calculating KPIs using SQL functions
Trend identification using timestamp
Ranking & conditional analysis
Energy efficiency insights through SQL logic

📈 Project Outcome :

This project helps understand patterns in building energy usage, identify inefficiencies, and highlight factors affecting consumption. It demonstrates strong skills in data analysis using SQL, especially for applications in building management, energy analytics, and sustainability.
